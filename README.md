# Vision_Verse_Project
1.Learnt and implemented noise reduction, contrast adjustment, and edge sharpening techniques to improve image quality.
2.Successfully implemented different Edge detection techniques to identify boundaries and features within an image. Edge Detection techniques include Laplacian, Canny Edge Detection, and Hough Transform.
4.Implemented different linear and non-linear filtering techniques such as Gaussian, Median, Bilateral, and High-Pass filters.   
5.Used Segmentation techniques such as K-means, and Otsu Segmentation which help to divide an image into meaningful regions, which is crucial for tasks such as object recognition, medical imaging, and image editing.
